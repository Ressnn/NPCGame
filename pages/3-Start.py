She is upset and speaks urgently, because she is worried about the missing prince and is also preparing for a banquet. The prince is a young child who is turning seven today, which is why she wants him to be found as soon as possible so that he’s not late for his birthday dinner. She is most concerned with telling you that you need to find the prince, who is missing somewhere in the garden, and worrying about how the dinner is going to be served on time if he’s still missing by sundown. When you ask her how to find the prince, she tells you to go around back to the garden, which is where he was last seen. In particular, you need to ask around for him, to see if you can find someone else who knows which direction in the garden he went.",

Suddenly, a harried-looking woman in her 40s with an apron and flour-covered hands approaches you. She takes a deep breath before addressing you.",
