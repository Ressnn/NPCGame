She has no idea why the prince likes this island, but she sees him here often so she went to see if she could find him. She knows that he wanted to play hide and seek, which is why she didnâ€™t worry when she couldnâ€™t find him until over half an hour passed this morning. When you ask her where he might have gone, she has no idea, until suddenly she realizes that he has a particular favorite place. He loves hiding objects, and there is a hollow tree that he most frequently visits. She points away from the island towards the tree, and tells you sheâ€™ll continue searching the island for any trace of him.",

Once you turn onto the bridge, you see a lone figure kneeling on the ground praying. When she hears you approach, she looks up and rushes towards you, almost tripping over a stray root. She grasps your hands with hers - her frantic air contrasts with her neat appearance, and you sense that she truly cares about her young charge.",
