She is sweet-natured but confused about why you are talking to her, because normally only her nanny and noble adults address her. When you ask her about the prince, she looks around briefly as if she expects him to pop up. When she doesn’t locate him, she tells you it’s his birthday and she gave him a toy boat, so he’s probably floating it somewhere. As she says this, a worried expression crosses her face, because she remembers that he can’t swim. She tells you that he’s probably near water, like the duck pond, which is further in the garden, with his nanny. She adds that she likes feeding ducks too, before she goes back to skipping stones. ",
"near" : "Canal",
"description" :
"The winding path around the edge of the garden highlights the glistening water of the river. You hear slight splashing noises to the right of you, and as you peer around the bend you see a young girl skipping stones. She squeals and spins around in excitement as one of her stones skips four times, before noticing you and stopping to stare up at you with guileless blue eyes.She’s around six years old, with a pink dress and pigtails with matching ribbons. Other than slightly dusty hands from the stones, she is perfectly kempt, as if she has been prepared for a future event. An older woman, presumably her caretaker, stands at a respectable distance and makes no move to intervene as you talk to the girl. ",
